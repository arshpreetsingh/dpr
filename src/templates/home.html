      <h2>What is a digital profile?</h2>

      <p>Profiling is the process of building a profile using information collected from available data. In general terms, a profile is a description of characteristics of a
person or entity. A digital profile extends the latter term to include a digital representation, of a person or entity, which considers the characteristics and
preferences of their online activity.
<br>
Digital footprints are a unique set of online activities, actions, and communications that leave a data trace on the Internet, computers, and other devices. It
includes activities such as websites you visit, emails you send, and information you submit to online services.
</p>

      <h2>Managing your reputation</h2>
      <p>
Create a positive digital footprint. The data you create online tells others such as Employers, Universities, Law Enforcement, Teachers, and Parents
what you have said, what others have said about you, images of you tagged online, browsing habits, personal information, and the most important, social media
profiles. What does your digital footprint reveal?

      <h2>Dpr Reporting and Rating</h2>
      <p>

Just as a person or entity manages their credit reports and scores via Experian or Moodyâ€™s for example, it is now necessary in the world we live in today to know
if our digital profiles are positive, average, or negative.
<br>
Why? Because our reports and ratings help entities and individuals to understand the consequences of desired or undesired behavior that may be revealed. For
example, our reports and ratings can help HR or Talent Management select the appropriate candidate for a job (keep in mind that some entities are looking for
candidates with undesirable behavior because that is their brand). Or they can inform job applicants what potential employers may learn about their online
activities and provide them the opportunity to clean up their digital if applicable. Further, this service will help entities maintain sustainable reputations and
guard against negative impressions.
